# Deep-Learning-TensorFlow
Neural Networking with Tensor-Flow

The random data was generated, the model was outlined , and was fit to the data. 
The Machine Learning Algorithm learnt the underline relationship of the data. I also configured the learning process by selecting the objective function and the optimization algorithm.

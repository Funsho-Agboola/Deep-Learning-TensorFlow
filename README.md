# Deep-Learning-TensorFlow
Neural Networking with Tensor-Flow

The random data was generated, the model was outlined and was fit to the data. 
The Machine Learning Algorithm learnt the underline relationship of the data. Also,the learning process was configured by selecting the objective function and the optimization algorithm.
